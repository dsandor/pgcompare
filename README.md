# pgcompare
Postgres Database Compare for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

PG Compare will allow you to compare two Postgres databases.  This application does not script out the changes but
instead shows the changes between two database schemas.  `Tables` and `Functions` are currently the only schema objects
that are compared.

The application's shell is based on the [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) project.  The UI is presented using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
